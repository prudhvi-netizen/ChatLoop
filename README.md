🍽️ ChatLoop – An AI-Powered Restaurant Chatbot
ChatLoop is a conversational AI chatbot built for restaurant order automation. It allows users to interact in natural language and place food orders, get menu recommendations, and check prices — all through a seamless chat interface.

This project showcases the power of LLMs in real-world customer-facing applications by combining a friendly UI with a smart language model backend (OpenAI GPT).

🧠 What It Does
Helps users browse the menu and explore cuisines

Takes food orders in natural language (like “I’d like lasagna and a smoothie”)

Responds conversationally and updates order details in real-time

Can suggest dishes, confirm quantities, and handle multi-turn interactions
